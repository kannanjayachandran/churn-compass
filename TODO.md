1. Create Docker compose file for development environment
    - Define services for the application, database, and any other dependencies(api, frontend, mlflow, db).
    - Configure volumes for persistent data storage (db).

1. Create a simple log parser/aggregator for the logs generated by the application.
    - This should be absolutely basic
    - Use something like jsonql to parse the logs
    - We currently don't want any complex setup.

1. Migrate from SDV to Faker/something simple
    - It is heavy, has too many dependencies, and is not maintainable
    - Prefect has something similar
